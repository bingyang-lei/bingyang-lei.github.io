## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Nanjing University(NJU), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

After three years of study, I have discovered a growing interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Computer Science, and I aspire to pursue a doctoral degree in this field in the future.

## Research Interests

- **Machnie Learning and LLM :** LLM for NLP, Explainable LLM.
- **Reinforcement Learning :** Outcome-based RL, Test-time RL.
<!-- - **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
